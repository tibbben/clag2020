Abstract: More than half of the world population lives in cities. Nearly one billion people within this urban population live in informal communities that are generally not documented, lack land tenure, and are often beyond the reach of government services and infrastructure. Concurrent to this trend, maps and geospatial databases are recognized as powerful tools to aid community planning, mitigate poverty, assist in public health initiatives, and establish land tenure. This paper reports on how new technologies such as drone surveys, GPS, and open source GIS can be used in conjunction with established participatory mapping methodology can facilitate the construction of a Public/Participatory Geographic Information Systems (PPGIS) and thus the self-documentation of the informal urban community of Las Flores in Barranquilla, Colombia. Our goal is to outline an interdisciplinary and reproducible approach to “map the vernacular” which can enable more environmentally sustainable and socially just development during periods of intense urbanization. We ask how insights from participatory mapping, cartografía social, urban planning and indigenous data governance come together in the documentation process. Results suggest a shift from participatory mapping to participatory data gathering which deserves attention.
